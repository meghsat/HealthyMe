# HealthyMe
#### Designed and devised a ReactJS-based web application that enables users to upload health-related queries, which are then answered using a Natural language processing model with 75% testing accuracy. Additionally, users can upload images of infected areas, X-rays, or CT scans, which are detected and categorized for severity using Machine learning.

#### Developed a StreamLit web app that empowers Sequential Chains and Memory Buffers to effectively process health-related user queries. The app takes in a disease name and gives a list of symptoms and relevant medications to minimize these symptoms.
